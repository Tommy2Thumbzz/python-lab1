# Lab 3 - Exploratory Data Analysis of Player Metrics

This project is part of a self-directed Data Analyst Bootcamp, focused on building hands-on experience  with Python and real-world data analysis workflows.

## Project Overview

In this lab, we performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing player information such as:

- Name
- Position
- Team 
- Height (inches)
- Weight (pounds)

The primary goal was to

- Load and inspect a dataset using pandas
- Clean and filter columns relevant to analysis
- Visualize height vs. weight using seaborn and matplotlib

## 📈 Output

The final output is a scatter plot showing the relationship between player height and weight. The plot was saved locally as `player_chart.png` and pushed to this repo.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run

To run this script locally:

1. Clone the repo  
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
3. Run the script:

This will generate and display the player chart and save it as `player_chart.png`.

## 📚 Learning Objective

This lab helped reinforce:
- Column selection and data slicing in pandas
- Data visualization best practices
- Saving and committing project artifacts to GitHub
